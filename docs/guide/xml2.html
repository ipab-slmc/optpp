The XML file for OPT++ can be thought of as being broken down into
blocks of XML.  Each block must be "opened" and "closed".  The main
block is the OPT block.  It has two sub-blocks, ProblemSetup and the
algorithm block.  Each of those has sub-blocks which contain the
detailed information for OPT++.

The ProblemSetup block has four sub-blocks.  The first is the function
type.  In this case, it is "Library" since we are using the subroutine
interface.  You can see the data values for the Hock-Schittkowski
example.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
<OPT>
  <ProblemSetup>
    <Library Second="false" FEval="hs14" First="true" LibName="testexample.so" Init="init_hs14"/>
\endcode
</table>

The second sub-block is the VariableClass block.  It contains an array
of the optimization variables.  Recall that for Rosenbrock's function,
there are no bounds on the variables, so the "lower" and "upper"
values consist only of empty quotes.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
    <VariableClass numVariables="2">
      <Array name="VariableList">
        <Variables initVal="0.0" lower="" upper="" theName="OPT_x1"/>
        <Variables initVal="0.0" lower="" upper="" theName="OPT_x2"/>
      </Array>
    </VariableClass>
\endcode
</table>

The third sub-block is LConstraintClass.  The syntax may seem slightly
excessive, but it if really just an array of LinearConstraint blocks,
each of which is essentially a list of the variables and their
coefficients.  Each LinearConstraint also contains information about
the comparison operator (which can be >= or =) and the right-hand
side.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
    <LConstraintClass numLConstraints="1">
      <Array name="LinearConstraint">
        <LinearConstraint operator="=" constraintName="linear1" rhs="-1.0">
          <Table name="Variables">
            <Entry Variable="OPT_x1" Coefficient="1.0"/>
            <Entry Variable="OPT_x2" Coefficient="-2.0"/>
          </Table>
        </LinearConstraint>
      </Array>
    </LConstraintClass>
\endcode
</table>

The third sub-block is NLConstraintClass.  This is an array of
NonLinearConstraint blocks, each of which contains the description of
one of the nonlinear constraints.  This includes information about the
comparison operator (which can be >= or =) and the right-hand side.
The desription of the constraint itself is of the same form as that
for the function.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
    <NLConstraintClass numNLConstraints="1">
      <Array name="NonLinearConstraints">
        <NonLinearConstraint operator=">=" theName="nonlinear1" rhs="0.0">
          <Library Second="false" FEval="ineq_hs14" First="true" LibName="testexample.so" Init="init_hs14"/>
        </NonLinearConstraint>
      </Array>
    </NLConstraintClass>
  </ProblemSetup>
\endcode
</table>

The algorithm block is named according to the algorithm that is being
used.  In this case, it is NIPS.  (The other possibilities are CG,
Newton, and PDS.)  The algorithm block has three sub-blocks that
contain the algorithmic parameters.  There are the BasicOptions, the
AdvancedOptions, and the algorithm-specific parameters.  The
BasicOptions and AdvancedOptions are the same for all of the
algorithms.  The algorithm-specific parameters vary.  You can see what
they are for the different algorithms by looking at the examples in
the OPT++/tests/xml directory.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  <NIPS>
    <BasicOptions maxFeval="10000" outFile="tstHock14xml.out" maxIter="100" Debug="false"/>
    <AdvancedOptions maxStep="1.e3" conTol="1.49e-08" stepTol="1.49e-08" fcnTol="1.49e-08" gradTol="6.05e-06" minStep="1.49e-08"/>
    <argaezTapia lenBound="0.99995" centParm="0.2" maxBack="5"/>
  </NIPS>
</OPT>
\endcode
</table>
