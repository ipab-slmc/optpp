This example is intended to demonstrate how to set up and solve a very
simple problem using the subroutine interface.  We will show you how
to solve Rosenbrock's function in two dimensions, i.e.,

<em> minimize </em> \f[100(x_2 - x_{1}^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2 \f]

For this example, we will assume that there are no analytic
derivatives and no constraints.  We will also assume that the
subroutines that initialize and evaluate the function are in the same
file.  We step through the specifics below.

<ul>
  <li> \ref usercode <br>
  <li> \ref buildandrun <br>
</ul>

\section usercode User-Provided Subroutines

This section contains examples of the user-defined functions that are
required.  The first performs the initialization of the problem.  The
second performs the evaluation of the function.

First, include the necessary header files.  In this case, we need
iostream so we can print error messages and the OPT++ header file,
NLP.h, for some definitions.  Also, because we are going to great a
dynamically loadable library, we need to surround all of our code by
an extern "C" statement.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
#include <iostream>
#include "NLP.h"

extern "C" {
\endcode
</table>

The subroutine that initializes the problem should perform any
one-time tasks that are needed for the problem.  One part of that is
checking for error conditions in the setup.  In this case, the
dimension, <em>ndim</em>, can only take on a value of 2.  Using "exit"
is not the ideal way to deal with error conditions, but it serves well
as an example.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void init_rosen(int ndim, ColumnVector& x)
{
  if (ndim != 2) {
    cerr << "Number of variables for Rosenbrock's function should be 2."
	 << "  The number of variables given is " << ndim << endl;
    exit (1);
  } //end if
} //end init_rosen
\endcode
</table>

The other required subroutine will evaluate the function.  In this
problem, we are trying to find the minimum value of Rosenbrock's
function, so it is necessary to write the code that compute the value
of that function given some set of optimization parameters.
Mathematically, Rosenbrock's function is:

\f[f(x) = 100(x_2 - x_{1}^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2 \f]

The following code will compute the value of <em>f(x)</em>.

First, some manipulation of the optimization parameters, <em>x</em>,
is done.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void rosen0(int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, double& fx, int& result)
{
  double f1, f2, x1, x2;

  x1 = x(1);
  x2 = x(2);
  f1 = (x2 - x1 * x1);
  f2 = 1. - x1;
\endcode
</table>

Then the function value, <em>fx</em>, is computed, and the variable,
<em>result</em>, is set to indicate that a function evaluation was
performed.
  
<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  fx  = 100.* f1*f1 + f2*f2;
  result = NLPFunction;
} //end rosen0
} //end extern "C"
\endcode
</table>

Now that we have all of the code necessary to initialize and evaluate
Rosenbrock's function, give it a try!

\section buildandrun Building and Running the Example

If you want to try running this example, the following steps should do
the trick.

<ol>
  <li> cd into your favorite directory.
  <li> Write the code described above.  You can organize it however
  you like, but we recommend putting both subroutines in the same
  file (e.g., testexample.C).
  <li> Copy the Makefile from the tests/xml directory into the
  directory where your code resides.  (WARNING: Since the Makefile
  contains platform-dependent information, it should be one that was
  configured for the platform on which you are doing this example.)
  <li> Edit the Makefile by replacing the files listed in the existing
  SOURCES line with your file.  For example,
        \verbatim
           SOURCES = testexample.C
        \endverbatim
  <li> Type "make".  This step will create the library,
	testexample.so.
  <li> Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the directory
	where your library resides.  For us, the directory was
	/home/pdhough/TooMuchFun, so:
	\verbatim
	   for csh or tcsh, <br>
	   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/pdhough/TooMuchFun
	\endverbatim
	OR
	\verbatim
	   for bash, <br>
	   set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pdhough/TooMuchFun
	   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	\endverbatim
  <li> Create the XML input file for OPT++.  The initialization
	subroutine is init_rosen, the function subroutine is rosen0,
	and the library is testexample.so.  The number or variables is
	2, and there are no derivatives	or constraints.  If you want
	to duplicate our results, we used an initial guess of -1.2 for
	the first variable and 1.0 for the second.  We used the PDS
	algorithm with the default values for all of the parameters
	except for the maximum number of function evaluations, which
	we set to 10000.  We recommend putting the XML file in the
	same directory as your code so that you have all of your
	problem information in one place.
  <li> If you have set up OPT++ and the various environment variables
	as described in the documentations, you should now be able to
	run the problem by issuing the following command:
        \verbatim
           ./testexample
        \endverbatim

	If you like, you can compare your output to
	<a href="subroutine1_out.html"> our results</a>.  There may be
	slight differences, but if you used the same input that we
	did, the results should look pretty much the same.
</ol>
