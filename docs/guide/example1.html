This example is intended to demonstrate how to set up and solve a very
simple problem.  We will show you how to solve (unconstrained)
Rosenbrock's function in two dimensions, i.e.,

<em> minimize </em> \f[100(x_2 - x_{1}^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2 \f]

For demonstration purposes, we will assume that there are no analytic
derivatives available so we will use finite-difference approximations
to the gradient and a quasi-Newton algorithm with a BFGS approximation
to the Hessian.  Recall that it is necessary to write C++ code for the
main routine that sets up the problem and the algorithm and for the
subroutines that initialize and evaluate the function.  We step
through the specifics below.

<ul>
  <li> \ref main1 <br>
  <li> \ref function1 <br>
  <li> \ref run1 <br>
</ul>

\section main1 Main Routine

First include the necessary header files.  Start with any C++/C header
files that are needed.  In this case, a bit of I/O.  The other
two header files are OPT++ header files.  NLF contains objects, data,
and methods required for setting up the function/problem.  OptQNewton
contains the objects, data, and methods required for using an
unconstrained quasi-Newton optimization method. The last statement 
<em> using NEWMAT::ColumnVector</em> introduces the data member ColumnVector
from the matrix library namespace NEWMAT.  The use of namespaces prevents
potential conflicts with third party libraries that may also have a data
member named ColumnVector.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
#include <fstream>

#include "NLF.h"
#include "OptQNewton.h"

using NEWMAT::ColumnVector;
\endcode
</table>

The following two lines serve as the declarations of the pointers to the
subroutines that initialize the problem and evaluate the objective
function, respectively.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void init_rosen(int ndim, ColumnVector& x);
void rosen(int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, double& fx, int& result);
\endcode
</table>

The next few lines complete the setup of the problem, which include 
setting the dimension of the problem and creating the nonliner function
object.  To create the nonlinear function object use
the dimension of the problem and the pointers to the subroutines
declared above.  The FDNLF1 object has built-in finite-difference
approximations to the gradient.  

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
int main()
{
  int ndim = 2;

  FDNLF1 nlp(ndim, rosen, init_rosen);
\endcode
</table>
  
Now, let's build a quasi-Newton algorithm object using the nonlinear problem that
has just been created.  The quasi-Newton algorithm will use BFGS
updates to approximate the Hessian.  In addition, set any of the
algorithmic parameters to desired values.  All parameters have default
values, so it is not necessary to set them unless you have specific
values you wish to use.  In this example, we set the globalization
strategy, the maximum number of function evaluations allowed, the
function tolerance (used as a stopping criterion), and the name of the
output file.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  OptQNewton objfcn(&nlp);

  objfcn.setSearchStrategy(TrustRegion);
  objfcn.setMaxFeval(200);
  objfcn.setFcnTol(1.e-4);

// The "0" in the second argument says to create a new file.  A "1"
// would signify appending to an existing file.

  if (!objfcn.setOutputFile("example1.out", 0))
    cerr << "main: output file open failed" << endl;
\endcode
</table>

Now call the algorithm's optimize method to solve the problem.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  objfcn.optimize();
\endcode
</table>

Finally, print out some summary information and clean up before exiting.  The
summary information is handy, but not necessary.  The cleanup flushes
the I/O buffers.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  objfcn.printStatus("Solution from quasi-newton");
  objfcn.cleanup();
}
\endcode
</table>

Now that the main routine is in place, we step through the code
required for the initialization and evaluation of the function.

\section function1 User-Defined Functions

This section contains examples of the user-defined functions that are
required.  The first performs the initialization of the problem.  The
second performs the evaluation of the function.

First, include the necessary header files.  In this case, we need the
OPT++ header file, NLP, for some definitions.  Next, we define the scope of the
methods using namespace. The first statment introduces the data
member ColumnVector from the namespace NEWMAT.  The second statement allows
us to refer to all the methods in the OPTPP namespace.  These two statements
are crucial for a sucessful compilation.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
#include "NLP.h"

using NEWMAT::ColumnVector;
using namespace::OPTPP;
\endcode
</table>

The subroutine that initializes the problem should perform any
one-time tasks that are needed for the problem.  One part of that is
checking for error conditions in the setup.  In this case, the
dimension, <em>ndim</em>, can only take on a value of 2.  Using "exit"
is not the ideal way to deal with error conditions, but it serves well
as an example.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void init_rosen (int ndim, ColumnVector& x)
{
  if (ndim != 2)
    exit (1);
\endcode
</table>

The initialization is also an ideal place to set the initial values of
the optimization parameters, <em>x</em>.  This can be hard coded, as
done here, or it can be done in some other manner (e.g., reading them
in from a file, the code for which should appear here).

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
// ColumnVectors are indexed from 1, and they use parentheses around
// the index.

  x(1) = -1.2;
  x(2) =  1.0;
}
\endcode
</table>

The last piece of code is a subroutine that will evaluate the
function.  In this problem, we are trying to find the minimum value of
Rosenbrock's function, so it is necessary to write the code that
computes the value of that function given some set of optimization
parameters.  Mathematically, Rosenbrock's function is:

\f[f(x) = 100(x_2 - x_{1}^2)^2 + (1 - x_1)^2 \f]

The following code will compute the value of <em>f(x)</em>.

First, some error checking and manipulation of the optimization
parameters, <em>x</em>, are done.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void rosen(int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, double& fx, int& result)
{
  double f1, f2, x1, x2;

  if (ndim != 2)
    exit (1);

  x1 = x(1);
  x2 = x(2);
  f1 = (x2 - x1 * x1);
  f2 = 1. - x1;
\endcode
</table>

Then the function value, <em>fx</em>, is computed, and the variable,
<em>result</em>, is set to indicate that a function evaluation was
performed.
  
<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  fx  = 100.* f1*f1 + f2*f2;
  result = NLPFunction;
}
\endcode
</table>

On a more general note, this subroutine could serve as a wrapper to a
C or Fortran subroutine.  Similarly, it could make a system call to a
completely independent executable.  As long as the values of
<em>fx</em> and <em>result</em> are set when all is said and done, it
does not matter how the function value is computed.

Now that we have all of the code necessary to set up and solve
Rosenbrock's function, give it a try!

\section run1 Building and Running the Example
Building your executable should be fairly straightforward.  Below is
the recommended set of steps to follow.
<ol>
      <li> Determine which defines you need.  If the C++ compiler you
	   are using supports the ANSI standard style of C header
	   files, you will need
           \verbatim
		-DHAVE_STD
           \endverbatim
	   If the C++ compiler you are using supports namespaces, you
	   will need
           \verbatim
		-DHAVE_NAMESPACES
           \endverbatim
	   If you are using the parallel version of OPT++, you will
	   need
           \verbatim
		-DWITH_MPI
           \endverbatim
      <li> Determine the location of the header files.  If you did a
	   "make install", they will be located in the "include"
	   subdirectory of the directory in which OPT++ is installed.
	   If that directory is not one your compiler normally checks,
	   you will need
           \verbatim
		-IOPT++_install_directory/include
           \endverbatim
	   If you did not do a "make install", the header files will
	   almost certainly be in a directory not checked by your
	   compiler.  Thus, you will need
           \verbatim
		-IOPT++_top_directory/include -IOPT++_top_directory/newmat11
           \endverbatim
	<li> Determine the location of the libraries.  If you did a
	   "make install", they will be located in the "lib"
	   subdirectory of the directory in which OPT++ is installed.
	   If that directory is not one your compiler normally checks,
	   you will need
           \verbatim
		-LOPT++_install_directory/lib
           \endverbatim
	   If you did not do a "make install", the libraries will
	   almost certainly be in a directory not checked by your
	   compiler.  Thus, you will need
           \verbatim
		-LOPT++_top_directory/lib/.libs
           \endverbatim
	<li> If you configured OPT++ for the default behavior of using
	   the BLAS and/or you configure OPT++ to use NPSOL, you will
	   need the appropriate Fortran libraries for linking.  The
	   easiest way to get these is to look in the Makefile for the
	   value of FLIBS.
	<li> If all is right in the world, the following format for your
	   compilation command should work:
           \verbatim
		$CXX <defines> <includes> example1.C tstfcn.C <lib \
		directory> -lopt -lnewmat -l$BLAS_LIB $FLIBS 
           \endverbatim
	   $CXX is the C++ compiler you are using.  <defines> and
	   <includes> are the flags determined in steps 1-2.  example1.C
	   is your main routine, and tstfcn.C contains your function
	   evaluations.  (Note: If you have put them both in one file,
	   you need only list that single file here.)  <lib_directory
	   was determined in step 3.  -lopt and -lnewmat are the two
	   OPT++ libraries.  $BLAS_LIB is the BLAS library you are
	   using, and $FLIBS is the list of Fortran libraries
	   determined in step 4.
</ol>
You should now be able to run the executable (type "./example1").  You
can compare the results, found in example1.out, to <a
href="example1_out.html">our results</a>.  There may be slight
differences due to operating system, compiler, etc., but the results
should very nearly match.
