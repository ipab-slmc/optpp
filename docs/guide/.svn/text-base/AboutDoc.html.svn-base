/** \page AboutDoc Read me first

OPT++ is an experimental package of algorithms for nonlinear equations
and optimization written in C++. The motivation for this package is to
build an environment for the rapid prototyping and development of new
algorithms in optimization.


WARNING: This is a RESEARCH code. I won't claim that this is very
robust code and my experience with C++ compilers makes me believe that
there is much to be done to improve the reliability of this package.
I would be happy to incorporate any changes that are necessary to make
this package run on other machines/compilers and any bugs or
suggestions for improvement are welcome. Direct all messages to the

Developers</A>.
