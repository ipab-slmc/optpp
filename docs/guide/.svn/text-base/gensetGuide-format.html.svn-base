/** \page gensetGuide-format Choosing a Generating Set for OptGSS 

A generating set for <b>R<sup>n</sup></b> is a set of vectors that 
can generate any point in <b>R<sup>n</sup></b> by linear combinations with 
positive coefficients.
<br>
Currently, OPT++ contains three Generating Set Search options for OptGSS.
The first two can be used for n-dimensional problems, whereas
the third is applicable only for two-dimensional problems.

<b>GenSetStd:</b>

<table cellpadding="10"><tr>
<td>

<td valign="top">
The standard generating set has 2<b>n</b> elements and
consists of the columns of the identity matrix and its negative. <br>
<center>{I, -I}</center>
The standard generating set gives rise to the well-known compass-search 
algorithm, which searches both sides of every Cartesian direction.

<b>GenSetMin:</b>
<table cellpadding="10"><tr>
<td>
<img src="../images/gensetMin.gif">
<td valign="top">
A generating set for <b>R<sup>n</sup></b> must
contain at least <b>n</b>+1 elements. The standard minimal 
generating set consists of the columns of the identity matrix plus 
the vector with all entries equal to -1.
<br>
<center>{I, -1}</center>
The standard minimal generating set is useful for problems with 
expensive function evaluations.

<b>GenSetBox2d:</b>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10"><tr>

<img src="../images/gensetBox.gif">
<td valign="top">
The Box generating set augments the standard generating set
with the corners of a <b>n</b> dimensional hypercube (or "box").
In OPT++, the Box generating set has been implemented for <b>n</b>=2,
where the corner vectors are <br>
<center>{(1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1)}.</center>
This generating set can be used instead of the standard set for
two dimensional problems with inexpensive function evaluations.
The additional directions can significantly improve the algorithm's
convergence rate.
