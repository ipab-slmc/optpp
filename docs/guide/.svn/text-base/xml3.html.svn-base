The XML file for OPT++ can be thought of as being broken down into
blocks of XML.  Each block must be "opened" and "closed".  The main
block is the OPT block.  It has two sub-blocks, ProblemSetup and the
algorithm block.  Each of those has sub-blocks which contain the
detailed information for OPT++.

The ProblemSetup block has four sub-blocks.  The first is the function
type.  In this case, it is "Application" since we are using the
application interface.  You can see the data values for the
Rosenbrock's function example.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
<OPT>
  <ProblemSetup>
    <Application modelDir="/home/pdhough/TooMuchFun" modelInput="rosen.in" scriptName="rosen.e"/>
\endcode
</table>

The second sub-block is the VariableClass block.  It contains an array
of the optimization variables.  In this case, we have put both upper
and lower bounds on the variables.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
    <VariableClass numVariables="2">
      <Array name="VariableList">
        <Variables initVal="-1.2" lower="-5.0" upper="5.0" theName="OPT_x1"/>
        <Variables initVal="1.0" lower="-5.0" upper="5.0" theName="OPT_x2"/>
        </Variables>
      </Array>
    </VariableClass>
\endcode
</table>

The third and fourth sub-blocks are LConstraintClass and
NLConstraintClass, respectively.  Recall that there are no
constraints, these blocks take the following form.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
    <LConstraintClass numLConstraints="0">
      <Array name="LinearConstraint"/>
    </LConstraintClass>
    <NLConstraintClass numNLConstraints="0">
      <Array name="NonLinearConstraints"/>
    </NLConstraintClass>
  </ProblemSetup>
\endcode
</table>

The algorithm block is named according to the algorithm that is being
used.  In this case, it is Newton.  (The other possibilities are CG,
PDS, and NIPS.)  The algorithm block has three sub-blocks that
contain the algorithmic parameters.  There are the BasicOptions, the
AdvancedOptions, and the algorithm-specific parameters.  The
BasicOptions and AdvancedOptions are the same for all of the
algorithms.  The algorithm-specific parameters vary.  You can see what
they are for the different algorithms by looking at the examples in
the OPT++/tests/xml directory.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  <Newton>
    <BasicOptions maxFeval="10000" outFile="tstTRPDSapp.out" maxIter="100" Debug="false"/>
    <AdvancedOptions maxStep="1.e3" conTol="1.49e-08" stepTol="1.49e-08" fcnTol="1.49e-08" gradTol="6.05e-06" minStep="1.49e-08"/>
    <trustPDS searchSize="64" gradMult="0.1"/>
  </Newton>
</OPT>
\endcode
</table>
