\section intro Introduction

OPT++ is a C++ library of nonlinear optimization algorithms.  The
motivation for this package is to build an environment for the rapid
prototyping and development of new optimization algorithms.  In
particular, the focus is on robust and efficient algorithms for
problems in which the function and constraint evaluations require the
execution of an expensive computer simulation.

Currently, OPT++ includes the classic Newton methods, a nonlinear
interior-point method, parallel direct search, a trust region -
parallel direct search hybrid, a generating set search, and a wrapper
to NPSOL.  Between these methods, a wide range of problems can be
solved, e.g. with or without constraints, with or without analytic
gradients, simulation based, etc.

Thanks to Sherae Daniel of the University of Maryland and Andrew
Rothfuss of Sandia National Labs for help with the GUI/XML interface.
Thanks also to Edward Walsh and Shane Brown, both of Sandia National
Labs, for their assistance in converting the build system to
autotools.
