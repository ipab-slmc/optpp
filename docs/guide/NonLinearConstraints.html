\section NonLinearConstraintFunctions Declaring Nonlinear Constraint Functions
Like the objective function, the nonlinear constraint functions are 
classified according to the availability of the derivatives.
However, the argument list of the constructors for the two objects differ
in the storage types for the function's value, gradient, and Hessian.
<ul>
	<li> \code
typedef void (*USERNLNCON0)(int, const ColumnVector&, ColumnVector&, int&);
\endcode
For a nonlinear constraint the third argument is a ColumnVector because
storage is needed for \a ncnln values. The corresponding declaration for
a \a trig_constraint follows:
\code
   void trig_constraint(ndim, x, cvalue, result);
\endcode

<li> \code
typedef void (*USERNLNCON1)(int, int, const ColumnVector&, ColumnVector&, 
                            Matrix&, int&);
\endcode
An example for a constraint function with
first derivative information available is
\code
   void rosen_constraint(mode, n, x, cvalue, cJacobian, result);
\endcode
The fifth argument, a Matrix, contains the Jacobian of the
constraints. 

<li> \code
typedef void (*USERNLNCON2)(int, int, const ColumnVector&, ColumnVector&, 
			    Matrix&, OptppArray<SymmetricMatrix>&, int&);
\endcode
The declaration for a constraint function with analytic Hessian follows:
\code
   void illum2_constraint(mode, n, x, cvalue, cJacobian, cHessian, result);
\endcode
The sixth argument, an array of symmetric matrices, contains the 
Hessians of the constraints.
</ul>
Now, we turn our focus to the construction of nonlinear equations.

\section NonLinearEquations Creating Nonlinear Equations 
The nonlinear equation is written as \f[ h(x) =  0. \f]

There are two NonLinearEquation constructors.
The first constructor requires two parameters, a pointer to
an NLP object and an integer argument for the number of nonlinear equations, 
which defaults to one.  The right-hand side is set to zero.
For example,
\code
   NonLinearEquation(NLP* nlprob, int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode

The second constructor 
\code
   NonLinearEquation(NLP* nlprob, const ColumnVector& rhs, 
	            int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode
permits a nonzero value for the right-hand side. 

The following code fragment creates 
\f[ h_j(x) = j,  \forall j=1,2,3. \f]
\code
   //  Number of nonlinear equations 
   int ncnln    = 3;
   ColumnVector b(ncnln);
   
   //  Create a pointer to an NLP object 
   NLP* nlprob  = new NLP( new NLF1(n, ncnln, nleqn, init_nleqn) );

   //  Initialize the right-hand side of the equations 
   b << 1.0 << 2.0 << 3.0;

   //  Create a set of nonlinear equations 
   NonLinearEquation(nlprob, b, ncnln);
\endcode

\section NonLinearInequalities Creating Nonlinear Inequalities
In OPT++, the standard form for a nonlinear inequality is
\f[ g(x) \ge  0. \f]
The corresponding constructor is
\code
   NonLinearInequality(NLP* nlprob, int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode

To define a nonzero right-hand side for the inequalities, use the following
constructor:
\code
   NonLinearInequality(NLP* nlprob, const ColumnVector& rhs, 
                       int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode

If the user wants nonzero upper bounds on the constraints, such as
\f[ g(x) \le  b, \f] then they must use the following constructor:
\code
   NonLinearInequality(NLP* nlprob, const ColumnVector& rhs, 
                       const bool flag, int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode

To create lower and upper bounds for the constraints, use
\code
   NonLinearInequality(NLP* nlprob, const ColumnVector& lower, 
                       const ColumnVector& upper, int numconstraints = 1);
\endcode
which generates 
\f[l \le g(x) \le  u. \f]

<p>
OPT++ does not support sparse constraints.  Therefore, a bound must be given 
for each variable even if only a subset of the constraints have finite bounds.
An infinite lower bound is specified by
\f[l_i \le -1.0e10. \f]
Similarly, an infinite upper bound is specified by
\f[u_i \ge  1.0e10. \f]
